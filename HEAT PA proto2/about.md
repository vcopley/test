## Introduction

This tool is designed to help you conduct an economic assessment of the health benefits of  cycling by estimating the value of reduced mortality that results from specified amounts of cycling.

This Etool can be used in a number of different situations, for example:

- when planning a new piece of cycling or walking infrastructure.  HEAT attaches a value to the estimated level of cycling when the new infrastructure is in place. This can be compared to the costs of implementing different interventions to produce a benefitâ€“cost ratio (and help to make the case for investment)

- to value the reduced mortality from past and/or current levels of cycling, such as to a specific workplace, across a city or in a country. It can also be used to illustrate economic consequences from a potential future change in levels of cycling or walking

- to provide input into more comprehensive economic appraisal exercises, or prospective health impact assessments.For example, to estimate the mortality benefits from achieving targets to increase cycling or walking, or from the results of an intervention project.
